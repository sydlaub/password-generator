# Password Generator

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow a user to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected. This is a useful application for someone to utitlize for maximum security on their accounts that may contain sensitive information. In the development of this site I was able to familiarize myself with important JavaScript concepts and put them into practice.
